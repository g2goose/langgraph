## Product Overview

### Vision Statement
LangGraph is the definitive low-level orchestration framework for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents that can operate reliably in production environments.

### Mission
To provide developers with the foundational infrastructure needed to create sophisticated agent systems that persist through failures, incorporate human oversight, maintain comprehensive memory, and scale confidently in production.

### Core Value Propositions

1. **Durable Execution**: Build agents that persist through failures and automatically resume from exact points of interruption
2. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Seamless integration of human oversight with inspection and modification capabilities
3. **Comprehensive Memory**: Stateful agents with both short-term working memory and long-term persistent memory
4. **Production-Ready Deployment**: Scalable infrastructure designed for stateful, long-running workflows
5. **Developer Experience**: Low-level control without abstraction of prompts or architecture

### Target Audience

- **Primary**: Senior developers and ML engineers building production agent systems
- **Secondary**: AI researchers prototyping complex agent workflows
- **Tertiary**: DevOps engineers deploying and maintaining agent infrastructure

### Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Number of active projects using LangGraph
- **Reliability**: Agent uptime and failure recovery rates
- **Performance**: Agent execution speed and resource efficiency
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Community feedback and contribution rates
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Number of integrations and extensions

## Change Management Framework

### Philosophy

LangGraph's change management framework is inspired by its own core concepts of **persistence**, **checkpoints**, and **state history**. Just as LangGraph agents maintain state across time, our product development maintains a clear audit trail of decisions, changes, and their impacts.

### Change Categories

#### 1. **Critical Changes** (Requires Full Committee Review)
- Breaking API changes
- Architecture modifications affecting core framework
- Security-related changes
- New major features or components

#### 2. **Standard Changes** (Requires Technical Review)
- New non-breaking features
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates
- Bug fixes affecting multiple components

#### 3. **Minor Changes** (Requires Peer Review)
- Bug fixes for specific components
- Code quality improvements
- Test additions
- Minor documentation corrections

## History Tracking System

### Versioning Strategy

LangGraph follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** with the following conventions:

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 2.1.0)
  - **MAJOR**: Breaking changes that require user action
  - **MINOR**: New features that are backward compatible
  - **PATCH**: Bug fixes and minor improvements

### Change History Documentation

#### 1. **Checkpoint System**
Each significant change creates a "checkpoint" in our development history:

```yaml
checkpoint:
  id: "CHG-2024-001"
  timestamp: "2024-12-19T10:30:00Z"
  version: "0.6.1"
  type: "feature"
  summary: "Added support for async checkpointers"
  components_affected:
    - "langgraph/checkpointers"
    - "langgraph/core"
  breaking_changes: false
  migration_guide: "docs/migration/v0.6.1.md"
  rollback_procedure: "docs/rollback/v0.6.1.md"
```

#### 2. **State History Tracking**
Maintains a comprehensive record of product evolution:

```json
{
  "state_history": [
    {
      "state_id": "v0.6.1",
      "timestamp": "2024-12-19T10:30:00Z",
      "changes": [
        {
          "change_id": "CHG-2024-001",
          "type": "feature",
          "description": "Added async checkpointer support",
          "author": "jane.doe@company.com",
          "reviewer": "john.smith@company.com",
          "tests_added": ["test_async_checkpointer.py"],
          "documentation_updated": ["docs/checkpointers.md"],
          "performance_impact": "+2% memory, -5% latency"
        }
      ],
      "validation_results": {
        "tests_passed": 1247,
        "tests_failed": 0,
        "coverage": "94.2%",
        "performance_benchmarks": "passed"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. **Decision Registry**
Documents architectural and product decisions:

```markdown
# Decision Record: DR-2024-012

## Title
Adoption of Async Checkpointer Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Users need better performance for long-running agents with frequent state saves.

## Decision
Implement async checkpointer interface to improve I/O performance.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: 40% improvement in checkpoint save/load times
- **Negative**: Increased complexity in error handling
- **Risks**: Potential race conditions in concurrent scenarios

## Alternatives Considered
1. Thread-based parallelization (rejected: GIL limitations)
2. Batch checkpointing (rejected: memory overhead)

## Implementation
- Timeline: 2 weeks
- Components: core, checkpointers
- Breaking changes: None (backward compatible)
```
